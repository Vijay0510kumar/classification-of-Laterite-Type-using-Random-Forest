# classification-of-Laterite-Type-using-Random-Forest based on Geotechnical properties

Overview

This project aims to build a Random Forest Classifier to predict the type of laterite based on various geotechnical properties. Accurate classification of laterite types is crucial in mining, construction, and geotechnical applications.

Dataset

the following geotechnical properties as input features:

Ds: Dry Density

UCS: Uniaxial Compressive Strength

IS50: Point Load Index (Strength Index at 50mm diameter)

TS: Tensile Strength

Pw: Porosity

Di: Degree of Saturation

Mc: Moisture Content

RQD: Rock Quality Designation

The target variable is the Laterite Type, which classifies laterite into different categories.

Objective

Develop a Random Forest Classifier to classify laterite type.

Analyze the impact of geotechnical properties on classification.

Optimize the model for high accuracy (>95%).

Methodology
